# Software architecture

## Why?

With this architecture we can show how the application integrates with eachother. This can also help the PSV Official app developers to connect to our API when a innovation get's approved.

## How

The architecture is made with the C4 principles.

### System context diagram

A System Context diagram is a good starting point for diagramming and documenting a software system, allowing you to step back and see the big picture.

### Container diagram

Once you understand how your system fits in to the overall IT environment, a really useful next step is to zoom-in to the system boundary with a Container diagram. A "container" is something like a server-side web application, single-page application, desktop application, mobile app, database schema, file system, etc. Essentially, a container is a separately runnable/deployable unit (e.g. a separate process space) that executes code or stores data.

### Component diagram

Next you can zoom in and decompose each container further to identify the major structural building blocks and their interactions.

## Result

### System context diagram

### Container diagram

### Component diagram

## Conclusion

With these results we can start developing the application in React Native.
