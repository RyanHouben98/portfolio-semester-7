# Dashboard

## Why?

I created a dashboard where PSV admins can create test users account and add innovations.

## How?

The application is build in React and uses the my PSV Innovations API.

With the library "RTK Query" I am able to fetch and manipulate data and also cache certain data when needed.

## Results

- A dashboard that can create test users.
- A dashboard that can create new innovations.

## Conclusion

With this dashboard PSV admins can easily add users and innovations. The next step is to add the feedback system and see the metrics the test users generate by testing the innovations.
