# Prototype 1

## Why?

We made our first prototype. We wanted to realise the ideas we came up to in the brainstorm session.

## How?

We picked up an old mannequin we found on marktplaats. After that we drilled some holes where we wanted our touch sensors to be.

The touch sensors are failry simple. It's just a wire with some aluminium foil that conducts electricity to the ESP32. based on this we can messure if the foil is getting touched or not. It was still very sensative and conflicted sometimes with the other wires.

## Result

<ReactPlayer controls url="/videos/prototype-1.mp4" />

## Conclusion

With this first prototype we validated that the basic functionality works. After this we are going to improve it with our own 3d model.
