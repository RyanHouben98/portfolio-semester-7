# Upfront Research

## Why?

Because we had a meeting planned with Jill and HenriÃ«t, we needed some context on what we are going to ask them.

## How?

We went for the library approach, because this could give us some quick context on what blind people looking for.

## Result

### Dating

The first thing we researched was: How do blind people date.

We where curios on how blind people are attracted to eachother. (Social Psychology: Attraction | SparkNotes, z.d.) mentions that the biggest factor for attraction among people is physical attraction bases on vision.

Because blind people cannot see they have other things they look for. (Chester, 2018) Did an interview with blind individuals on how they are attracted to other people. We came to the following conclusion on how they are attracted to eachother.

1. Voice
   - A lot of blind people are attracted to someones voice.
2. Smell
   - Smell is also a big factor for blind people. IF someone smells nice it can give a hint that the person is clean.
3. Talking
   - A lot of blind people are also attracted to a funny and smooth talking person, but this is also a big factor for seeing people.

Talking with Dilana also gave us some insights on how blind people date. She told us that it is a little harder for them, they like to go to more quieter places so they can really focus on eachother. But she also mentioned that they are a little used to it and don't know better so they find their own ways.

We also where curios on how blind people get sexual education in general. Because that is the biggest topic for this assignment.

### Sexual education

Based on the research (Wild, 2014) provided. we came up with the following conclusion:

1. Poor sexual education.
   - Most of the individuals did got some sexual education. But a lot of times it was visual based and not really available for them.
2. Age gap sexual education.
   - Because born blind people cannot see the difference between the other sex they have an age gap on sexual development in general.

## Conclusion

With the above research we have some general problems blind people have with sexual education/development.

We can come up with some questions and validate these problems to make a more defined problem statement later on in the project.
