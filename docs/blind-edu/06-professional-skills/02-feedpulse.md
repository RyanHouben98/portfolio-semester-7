# Feedpulse

## Why?

To keep the teachers up-to-date I did some feedpusle sessions, both with Ruud and Erik. Sometimes it was for the group project and sometimes for the personal project. From these feedpulse session I gathered usefull feedback to improve both projects.

## How?

The teacher and I talked about a certain topic, the provided feedback from the teachter then got wrote down in Feedpulse.

## Result

- [Feedpulse 1](/files/feedpulse/feedpulse-1.pdf)
- [Feedpulse 2](/files/feedpulse/feedpulse-2.pdf)

## Conclusion

With all the feedback gathered from the teachers we could really improve our project.

With those session we also got back on track when something went wrong (start of the project).
