# Prototype 2

## Why?

We made a second iteration of the prototype, because we wanted to use a real 3d model of a body that Peter provided us with.

## How?

Peter provided us with a 3d model of a real body.

We went to the ISSD and they printed it for us.

This is a small model, because we didn't have the knowledge on how to devide it into multiple pieces.

We also updated the foil with nails to have a more accurte point of contact.

It works the same as the other one, it only has other contact points and looks more realistic.

## Result

![Prototype 2](/img/prototype-model/prototype-2.jpeg)

## Conclusion

With this more realistic model we are going to do a user test with HenriÃ«t. After this user test we are going to make a third and final prototype of the model.
