# Contact person

## Why?

Because we had a lot of different stake holders (Dilana, Jill, HenriÃ«t and Peter), we decided that one person should be responsible for mail and other contacting traffic, to keep it easier for them and us.

## How?

Mail and messasing went via me. I also planned all the meetings and kept eveyone up-to-date.

## Result

Easy to manage all the planning with different stakeholders.
