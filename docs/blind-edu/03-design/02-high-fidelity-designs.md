# High Fidelity Designs

## Why?

Based on the low-fidelity designs we made high-fideltity designs. We made these for Dilana to make a quick prototype in the sprint reviews.

## How?

We made these based on the low-fidelity designs in mind. We also added the design report findings (colors, padding, etc).

## Result

## Conclusion

With this high fidelity prototype we can give Dilana an idea om how the application will look and function (clickable prototype). The designs also help us to develop the application faster and more professional.
