# Native application

## Why?

We made a native application for the teachers. With this application the teacher can configure the model, start quizes and control the model.

## How?

We made the application in Flutter because we wanted a hybrid approach, so we don't have to make multiple applications each for iOS and Andriod. We made the screens based on the high fidelity figma designs.

## Result

[Blind Edu appstore link](https://apps.apple.com/nl/app/blindedu/id6472726240)

## Conclusion

With this hybrid approach we saved us a lot of development time. Because we made a design based on a design document all the pages look inline with eachtother and gives it a professional look and feel.

We also deployed it to the appstore and playstore after several reviews.
