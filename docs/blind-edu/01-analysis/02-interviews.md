## Conclusion

In the upfront research we found something interesting on that blind teenagers have an age gap on sexual education. Jill and Henriët both confirmed this finding.
We also had a lot of topics on that blind people find in harder to date people. Both Jill and Henriët also confirmed this topic.

Based on the interviews we dropped the idea of doing something with personal care. They both mentioned that they have their tricks on this topic and it has nothing to do with sexual education.
