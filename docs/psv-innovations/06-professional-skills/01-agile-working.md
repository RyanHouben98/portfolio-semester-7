# Agile working

## Why?

Because we had to work together with the other Advanced Media group, there was a lot of communication going on. We had to plan a lot and devide tasks.

## How?

Branimir and I did a standup on 09:30 on the monday and the friday.

We also did stand-ups with the other group if our schedule let us do so.

## Result

[Agile workspace](https://git.fhict.nl/I441943/semester-7-psv-project)

## Conclusion

We really had to plan everything because we where with a lot of people. The Gitlab workspace really helped us keeping track of eveything. We also host our repositories here to save our code base.
