# Agile working

## Why?

Because at the start there was no control on who was doing what. I introduced everyone to the gitlab. We devided tasks and worked in sprints. We also did daily stand-ups to see how and what everyone was doing.

## How?

We wrote down all the tasks on the board. After that we devided everything in sprints and devided to work.

We started at 09:30 with a daily stand-up to talk about eachothers progress.

## Result

[Agile workspace](https://git.fhict.nl/I441943/blind-app-project/-/tree/main)

## Conclusion

After working more agile, everything went a lot smoother. Tasks got completed and there was progress in the project.
