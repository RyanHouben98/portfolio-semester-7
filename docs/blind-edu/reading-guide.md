# Reading Guide

In this reading guide, the project "BlindEdu" is described. The document provides an overview of the assignment's overall context and outlines the process we took to reach a final conclusion and product. Additionally, proof of the learning outcomes has been included in this reading guide for easy access to the portfolio, where all details are comprehensively described.

## The assignment:

In this current time, we do almost everything via internet. If we need some information about a certain topic, we search it up on our phone or other device and find what we need mostly within 5 minutes of searching the internet.

This also counts for sexual education. Yes, we can ask our parents for advice, but a lot of people find this a bit awkward to do. At a certain moment in our life, we know how the opposite sex body looks like, we saw it in movies, pictures, etc.

For born blind people this is a little more complex. Of course, they can use their phone to search up questions they have or maybe ask their parents if they are conferrable with that, touch their own body and imagine how it looks like, but most of these bord blind children/teenagers have no idea on how the opposite sex body looks or feels like.

Our PO (Dilana) wants to help those born blind people with sexual education. Together with some other teachers and born blind people, she started a group to make sexual education more available for blind people. She already mentioned that she had contact to make the website sense.info (a website where teenagers talk about sexuality) more available for blind people. But the real solution she wants is something like an application or prototype that is specially made for those born blind people and not seeing people.

Based on that introduction we got the following assignment.

**The assignment we got for this semester:**
Make a solution for born blind people to help them with sexual education.

## Description of the process and the results:

### Empathize

At the start of the project, we really lacked in this part. We mostly went straight to the ideate phase without even knowing what our target audience want and needs. We also didn’t have a straight goal to accomplish at the end of the semester. Because Dilana mentioned sense.info a lot, we wanted to make an application with the content of sense.info but made for blind people. Later on, this just didn’t work out. After a good wakeup call with Ruud we were back on track and ready to nail this project.

**Upfront research:**
The upfront research is for defining our interview questions. We planned an interview with Jill and Henriët to validate those findings. Some interesting facts that we came across is that young born blind people have an age gap on sexual education. Another big topic is that blind people find it harder to date. We also found a topic about personal care.

**Interview:**
Because we needed a main research question / design challenge we prepared an interview We interviewed Jill and Henriët. The questions were based on the topic: sexual education, dating experience, tech experience and personal background/care.

The results this interview where a real eye opener. We had a solid foundation on where we could focus on. The topics we wanted to focus on are: Dating and sexual education of children/teenagers.

### Define

Because we had two main topics (dating and sexual education of children/teenagers) we had to make a choice we would focus on. Because Henriët really validated our finding about the sexual education age gap among blind teenagers we went for that one.

Based on that we came up with the following:

**Problem statement:**
Kids who are born blind often struggle to understand the physical differences between boys and girls, which can lead to them feeling disconnected from sighted people who learn this naturally. When blind teenagers reach the age where they need sexual education, they find it hard to access because most materials and teachings rely on pictures and visual demonstrations. This lack of inclusive sexual education leaves blind teenagers without crucial information about their bodies, relationships, and sexual health. This knowledge gap can put them at risk for physical, emotional, and social challenges related to sex and relationships.

**Goal:**
"The goal is to create a smart mobile solution that provides blind teenagers at the age of 10 to 15 with accessible information about their bodies. This solution will help bridge the knowledge gap between blind and sighted individuals, ensuring that blind teenagers have equal access to important information for making informed decisions about their sexual health and relationships."
Main research question:
How can we incorporate the different senses to teach born blind teenagers at the age of 10 to 15 about the human body?

### Ideate

The next step is to come up with some new ideas. We took the main research question and started with a brainstorm session on how we can incorporate the different senses in our solution excluding vision and taste.

**Brainstorm session:**
We started our brainstorm session with the senses: Touch, smell, and hearing. We timeboxed this brainstorm session on 1 hour. After some findings we eventually got stuch on thinking about innovative ideas. Ruud told us about a method to generate random pictures and connect them to the context of the project. Based on what you see you must come up with new ideas, this really helped us to generate even more ideas.

The idea:
After this brainstorm session we had the idea to make a 3d model that can be touched and will give feedback to the blind people. We also wanted to look to a bigger picture and make this for a classroom environment where teachers can be in control of the model with an application.

The sub-questions:
Because we still had some questions, we came up with the following sub questions:

- What kinds of challenges do blind individuals have interacting with sensors?
  o Find at least 2 blind individuals for an interview.
- What kind of sensors are appropriate to use for learning about the human body?
  o Find at least 3 sensors for each sense (excluding vision and taste).
- How do blind teens get sexual education in school?
  o Find at least 3 methods.
  o Try to validate why our idea is better.

### Prototype

Together with the research we started to create our first prototype. This was a mannequin with some aluminum foil to sense touch with an ESP32. We also added the first version of the app that can connect with the model and provide sound from the model.

The second iteration is a 3d printed model. We contacted Peter, who is also a member of Dilana’s project group. He provided his print files to us. We also updated the app so that the teacher can see what is getting touched and we also added a quiz mode. We also played a little with the voices to make it more pleasant for children.

### Test

Together with Bram we went to Henriët in Armelo. Here did a user test with the model. She really liked the idea that we have and was surprised with the prototype we had. Of course, she also gave us some helpful feedback:

- She liked the voice we used, but it would be nice if it is changeable.
- The nails we used as touch points can be confusing for blind people.
- The “Hier ben ik” command is a little annoying, maybe only if you ask for it get a response back.

## Proof of the learning outcomes:

### Analysis

You can critically and methodically analyze a problem, opportunity, or technology in a smart mobile context.

**Self-assessment: Proficient**
Proficient: Analyzing the problem started out hard. In my opinion we had a hard assignment and target group. This resulted in that we got stuck analyzing the problem and context of the project. After a good talk with Ruud, we got back to work, and I think we did a decent Job finding our own problem statement and analyzing the target group.

It was a real learning process, that’s why I give rate myself proficient.

### Advice

Based on relevant analysis, you advice on suitable user interaction and technological design, improvement of designs, research and/or methodology.

**Self-assessment: Proficient**
At the start Dilana was really interested in an application that was specially made for blind people. After a lot of research, we made our own problem statement which we tough fitted much better for blind people. We documented this conclusion and discussed this with Dilana and she really liked the idea of closing the age gap that blind people have on sexual education on a younger age.

Because we really advised Dilana to take another route than just an application, I rate myself proficient.

### Design

You use a design process to create UX -and technological designs and validate your choices, in a context which is complex and subject to change.

**Self-assessment: Beginning/Proficient**
Because I am more into back-end development, this learning outcome was a little hard for me. A tried the help Branimir and Simeon as much as possible where I could. Because we were a little behand because of the rough start, we choose to divide the tasks based on our strengths. That’s why Design is a little behind for me.

### Realization:

Based on a relevant design you implement, validate and deploy an interactive and reliable smart mobile product.

**Self-assessment: Proficient/Advanced**
Realization was for me the most fun learning outcome. And in my opinion, we did a really good job. We not only deployed a production ready app to the app and play store but also made a 3d model that communicates with the application. We had multiple iterations with the application and prototypes of the model.

Because we not only have an application but also a piece of hardware and have multiple iterations which we also tested with the target group I rate myself advanced in realization.

- [Application](./04-realisation/03-native-application.md)

### Manage and control:

You continuously apply methodologies to manage a development process and to assure its quality in direct communication with all stakeholders.

**Self-assessment: Proficient**
Because we have a project that probably will be taken over by another group at the end of the semester, we had to make sure everything is documented for handover. I also was the contact person to Dilana and the target group, so we have one point for easy contact. We had sprint deliveries with Dilana and user tests with the target group to ensure we kept on the right track.

Because we had a lot of contact with stakeholders and did user tests with the target group, I rate myself proficient.

### Professional skills:

You demonstrate your professional development as a mobile developer in the form of authentic, professional IT tasks in which both the process and the result are visible.

**Self-assessment: Proficient**
At the start of the project, it was really pulling a dead horse, everybody was something (working on another project, doing nothing etc.). After a meeting with Erik and I we discussed on how to improve the group project. After the meeting we set some rules to work more agile, getting on time, daily stand-ups etc. After that we improved a lot as a group.

Because of the fact I tried to take the leader role and hold the group together I rate myself proficient.
