# Brainstorm Session (Functionality)

## Why?

After we had our first test session with Henriët we went back to the drawing board. We had a working prototype (some bugs needed to be fixed first), but the main implementation was there.

So we did another brainstorm session based on the main research question.

## How?

Based with the functionality we already have and the main research question in mind, we did another brainstorm session. We also used the random picture method Ruud tolds us about.

## Result

## Conclusion

Based on the brainstorm session we planned to do the following things for the next test session (11 Januray):

1. Bigger torso.
2. Sensors that sense touch through the plastic surface.
3. Implement the figma designs in the teacher application.
4. Create a hand-over document for the next group.
5. Implement the provided feedback Henriët gave us with the first user test.
