# Research Document

## Why?

Because we had a lot of loose research, we decided to make a research document that includes all of the research we did based on the "DOT" Framework.

## How?

We summed the Main research question and it's subquestion with the criteria.

We also added the DOT methods to each sub question so you have a clear overview on what has been done for the research question.

After that we included all the research we did per research question.

## Conclusion

Based on the research we did we can advice Delina not just to make an application that is only for Blind people. Blind people can use their phone, search up things on the internet etc. Ofcourse it is a little harder for them but they are not waiting on an application just for them.

We adviced her to close the age gap in sexual education with a torso they can teach and get feedback from based on some sensors. We also talked about the classroom environment to take this idea in the bigger picture so they can learn about this sensitive topic at school.
