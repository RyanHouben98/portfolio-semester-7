# Low Fidelity Designs

## Why?

To get a rough idea on how the application will look like, we made low fidelity prototypes. This will give us a quick look and idea on how the app will look like and function.

## How?

Based on the research we did and brainstorming about ideas and functionality we made these low fidelity designs in Figma.

## Result

## Conclusion

With these designs we can go to Dilana and show her roughly how the application will look like and function. Based on her feedback we can make high fidelity prototypes later on in the process.
