# Software choices

## Why?

I made this document to give more insights on why we chose certain software to develop our products.

## How?

For each component I made a brief description on why we chose the software.

## Result

### Dashboard

For the dashboard I chose React for the following reasons:

1.  **Component-Based Structure:**

    - React's component-based architecture simplifies UI development by breaking it into modular and reusable components.

2.  **Reusability:**

    - Components in React are highly reusable, saving time and effort in development.

3.  **Virtual DOM:**

    - React's virtual DOM optimizes UI updates for improved performance.

4.  **Declarative Syntax:**

    - React's declarative syntax makes UI code more straightforward and easier to understand.

5.  **Unidirectional Data Flow:**

    - React enforces a clear data flow, preventing unexpected side effects and simplifying debugging.

6.  **Community and Ecosystem:**

    - React has a large and active community, providing extensive resources, libraries, and tools.

7.  **React Hooks:**

    - Hooks simplify state management in functional components, making code concise and readable.

8.  **Integration and Libraries:**

    - React seamlessly integrates with various libraries and tools, enhancing its functionality.

9.  **Maintainability and Scalability:**

    - React's organized structure and modularity contribute to maintainable and scalable applications.

In summary, React offers a powerful and efficient development environment, particularly suited for building dashboards with complex UIs and data sets.

### Api

For the web api I chose .NEt for the following reasons:

1. **Language Interoperability:**

   - .NET supports multiple programming languages, including C#, F#, and VB.NET. This allows developers to choose the language they are most comfortable with while working within the same ecosystem.

2. **Performance:**

   - .NET is known for its performance and scalability. It provides features like Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation, which can lead to faster execution of code.

3. **Security Features:**

   - .NET offers robust security features, including built-in authentication and authorization mechanisms. It supports industry-standard security protocols such as OAuth and JWT for secure data transmission.

4. **Tooling and IDE Support:**

   - ASP.NET Core is a cross-platform, high-performance framework for building modern, cloud-based, and internet-connected applications. It's open-source and can run on Windows, Linux, and macOS, providing flexibility in deployment.

5. **Cross-Platform Development:**

   - .NET applications, including web APIs, can be easily scaled horizontally to handle increased load. This is particularly important for applications experiencing growth in user traffic.

6. **Extensive Libraries and Frameworks:**

   - .NET provides a rich set of libraries and frameworks that can expedite development. Libraries such as Entity Framework simplify database operations, and ASP.NET Core MVC aids in building scalable web applications.

7. **Community and Support:**

   - .NET has a large and active community, providing access to forums, tutorials, and third-party libraries. Microsoft also offers official support, ensuring developers have resources to address challenges.

### Application

For the native application we chose React-Native for the following reasons:

1.  **Cross-Platform Development:**

    - React Native allows you to write code once and deploy it on both iOS and Android platforms. This significantly reduces development time and effort compared to building separate codebases for each platform.

2.  **Code Reusability:**

    - With React Native, a substantial portion of your codebase can be reused between iOS and Android applications. This includes business logic, APIs, and some UI components, leading to faster development cycles and easier maintenance.

3.  **Large Developer Community:**

    - React Native has a large and active community, providing access to a wealth of resources, libraries, and third-party plugins. This community support can be beneficial for troubleshooting issues and finding solutions to common challenges.

4.  **Native Performance:**

    - React Native allows you to build native mobile applications with near-native performance. It achieves this by using native components and optimizing the app's performance through native modules.

5.  **Access to Native Modules:**

    - React Native provides a way to integrate native modules written in Swift, Objective-C (for iOS), and Java, Kotlin (for Android) into your application. This allows you to leverage platform-specific functionality when needed.

6.  **Community Plugins and Libraries:**

    - React Native has a rich ecosystem of community-contributed plugins and libraries. These can be easily integrated into your project to add functionalities such as navigation, maps, and social media integration.

7.  **Updates and Maintenance:**

    - React Native simplifies the process of releasing updates and handling maintenance. Since changes can be made on the server side, users receive updates without having to go through app store approvals.
