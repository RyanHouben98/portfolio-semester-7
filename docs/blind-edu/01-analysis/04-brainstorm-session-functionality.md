# Brainstorm Session (Functionality)

## Why?

After we had our first test session with HenriÃ«t we went back to the drawing board. We had a working prototype (some bugs needed to be fixed first), but the main implementation was there.

So we did another brainstorm session based on the main research question.

## How?

Based with the functionality we already have and the main research question in mind, we did another brainstorm session. We also used the random picture method Ruud tolds us about.

## Result

## Conclusion
