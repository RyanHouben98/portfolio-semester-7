# User testing

## Why?

We want to test if our findings and prototypes with user testing. PSV will arrange this testing phase with multiple test users.

## How?

PSV will arrange some staff people who will use the application. They can use multiple innovations (Sorama's audio module for example). After they tested these innovations, they will use the feedback system to provide PSV and the project groupd with feedback.

All the test results will then be documented and analysed.

## Result

Test results will come in after January 11th.

## Conclusion

After these tests we can conclude if our project was a real success or that there is still some work to be done, for example is the feedback system really working like the research concluded.
