# Debriefing

## Why?

We did a debriefing with Victor after getting the project by Erik. We had some question about the asignment.

## How?

Erik started the project by providing me the following overview of the assignment:
“At PSV our vision is to create stars together, among our fans & followers, employees &
volunteers, partners and players & staff. Innovation is one of our core values and we believe
that by collaborating with industry, education and government will help the future of our
club. We’re innovating to create impact on performance, fan engagement in stadium & at
home and other domains. We believe that web&app can play a core role in the interaction
with our fans. We’re looking for an app that can be build modular and adaptive to different
use cases. The idea is that we’ll have a PSV Innovation/Test app that can be shared with a
selected group of users who will test innovative features/concepts. If some of
those features/concepts are received positively we can take such modules to the official
app. Concepts to think about (some have been developed by previous FHICT students):
Interactive betting, loyalty program, interactive lyrics for stadium visitors, AR overlay with
stats of players during the game. The exact assignment is to be discussed with students and
companies (which could include: Sorama, Dutch Rose Media, and other innovation partners).
We want students to continue the work of previous semester and build solutions that we can
implement with real users.”

Looking at this global overview I gathered the following conclusions:

- Testing Application.
- Modular
- Selected group of test users.
- Concepts (audio, VR, AR, etc.).
- Open exercise (“The exact assignment has to be discussed”).

After this Branimir also got introduced to the project.
There is also an Advanced Media group working full time on this project and we will work
together on this project.

**Debrief with Victor:**
To validate the conclusions I found with the brief introduction Erik provided; Branimir, the
other group and I planned a meeting with the PO of the project, Victor.
Victor works at PSV and oversees the whole innovation sector at PSV. At our first meeting he
gave us a presentation about the project and validated the conclusions. He also mentioned
that the “Brainport Experience box” inside the stadium from previous semesters is gone, duo
high costs and low demand.

## Result

The presentation Victor gave us was pretty clear. He was really clear on how the project should look like and came up with the following:

- Closed test program (PSV creates accounts for the test users).
- Application for testing innovations.
- Feedback system that provides feedback to the PSV Staff.

## Conclusion

It was nice that Victor was realy clear about the project. Because we where 4 weeks behind this saved us some time in the analysing phase. With the results Victor gave us we are going to make some personas and empathy maps to gain more knowledge about our target audience.
