# Personas

## Why?

Creating personas is crucial for user-centered design. Personas are fictional characters representing user types, aiding in understanding user needs, guiding decision-making, aligning teams, facilitating communication, building empathy, mitigating risks, and informing targeted marketing. They humanize users and ensure a focus on individual motivations and challenges.

## How?

We made three personas, each one for the target group we are dealing with:

### Developer

This is a persona for an innovation developer.

### Tester

This is a persona for an innovation tester.

### PSV Staff

This is a persona for staff members of PSV.

## Result

## Developer

## Conclusion

With these personas we get a better understanding of our target audience. We also can make some empathy maps to get even more insights.
