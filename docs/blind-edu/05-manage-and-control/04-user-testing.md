# User testing

## Why?

We did user testing with Henriët. We wanted to validate our prototype and research.

## How?

The first time Bram and I went to Armelo. We gave Henriët some context on how to use the prototype and let her do her thing.

As you can see in the video there were still some bugs ocurring.

## Result

<ReactPlayer controls url="/videos/prototype-2.mp4" />

## Conclusion

We gathered a lot of good feedback:

- Different voices would be nice.
- More touch points.
- Bigger model.
- No nails as touch points (feels weird).
- Less repetetion with the voice.

With this feedback we are going to make a third prototype and do a second user test.
